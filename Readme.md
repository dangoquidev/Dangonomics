# Dangonomics

Welcome to **Dangonomics**, the digital classroom of Dango (Alex Pereira de Almeida)  
A 5th-year Epitech student, APE for Epitech Bachelor, web dev enthusiast, and weeb who loves drawing and spamming League of Legends between commits (´∀｀)

This repo is my cozy little place to learn, create, and share lessons — both for myself and for anyone curious enough to explore.

## About This Repo

**Dangonomics** is a growing collection of lessons, exercises, and templates I create to:
- Practice explaining technical concepts clearly  
- Prepare material for students I mentor  
- Experiment with Markdown and GitHub repo design  

Basically, it's like a classroom, but made of commits and caffeine.
